You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute to any
part of the documentation, such as the official docs, docstrings, or even
on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

  are welcome :)

   make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem.
2. The pull request should be created under a self branch if possible.
3. If the pull request relates to any of the functions in the package, the documentation should be updated as well.
