# DSCI 524 Group Project Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we present this Code of Conduct to lay down a healthy, friendly and encouraging environment for all who wish to contribute to this project. This is integral to ensuring that the project will grow successfully and upholding our responsibility to the overall software ecosystem. 

### Diversity and Inclusivity

Establishing a pleasant and inclusive environment for all contributors is of utmost importance. Our philosophy of realizing success is to create an atmosphere where everyone feels welcome and motivated to contribute their unique perspectives and ideas. We emphasize that everyone, no matter their appearance, nationality, religion, cultural background, skin color, religion, age or gender identity, warrants the same respect and treatment in all phases of contribution and developments of the project. We pledge to abide by UBC's Student Code of Conduct.

### Acceptable and Unacceptable Behaviors

Upholding the integrity and responsibility of this project requires high standards of respect and conduct expected from all contributors. This includes: 
-  Respect and understanding of culture and language differences and barriers 
-  Supportive, encouraging and open-minded attitude towards diverging opinions 
-  Amicable and respectful communication in all mediums

Examples of unacceptable behavior includes and not limited to: 
-  Usage of threatening or harassing communication 
-  Intimidation or resorting to physical violence 
-  Cheating or conducting plagiarism of any form 
-  Releasing sensitive and private information of other individuals (bank information, home address, etc.) 
-  Usage of sexual, violent, or other inappropriate content in all forms of communications both in personal and virtual settings 
-  Violating UBC's Student Code of Conduct

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

To protect the integrity of this project, we will adopt a vigilant and proactive mindset towards any form of unacceptable behavior. If any of the contributors are found to violate the Code of Conduct, we ask you to report it to DSCI524 instructors (Daniel Chen and Florencia D'Andrea) and/or MDS Co-Directors (Varada Kolhatkar and Rodolfo Lourenzutti).  Any contributor violating the code of conduct in any MDS forum, no matter if it's in the classroom, virtual meetings, or group work will be warned and expected to stop their inappropriate behavior. If they continue to engage in such behavior, we reserve the right to permanently ban them from contributing and engage with the MDS Co-Directors to investigate further and impose appropriate sanctions.
